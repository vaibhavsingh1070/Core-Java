    // Benefits of using Collection framework
        // 1. efficient data management
        // 2. Reusable Code
        // 3. Standardization
        // 4. Collections are used extensively in Java libraries and APIs

        // Where it is used
        // 1. Data Storage
        // 2. Algorithm Implementation: Many algorithms, like sorting and searching
        // 3. Frameworks and Libraries: Most Java frameworks (like Spring, Hibernate)
        // 4. Application Development

        // Overview of the Collections Framework
        //1. Collection: The root interface from which most collections derive.
        //2. List: Ordered collections that allow duplicate elements. (e.g., ArrayList, LinkedList)
        //3. Set: Collections that do not allow duplicate elements. (e.g., HashSet, TreeSet)
        //4. Queue: Collections used to hold multiple elements prior to processing. (e.g., LinkedList, PriorityQueue)
        //5. Map: Objects that map keys to values, without duplicate keys. (e.g., HashMap, TreeMap)
    
        //Code with Harry
        //Arraylist - > for variable size collection
        //Set - > for distinct collection
        //Stack -> LIFO data structure
        //Hashmap -> For storing key value pairs
